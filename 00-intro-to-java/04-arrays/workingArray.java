// How does Array List work ? How can it accept a greater number of inputs ?

// Ans
// When the list is filled by a certain amount (x / total) then
// a new array list is created with double the size of the previous list
// and all the elements from the current list are transfered to the new 
// list.

// x is usually considered to be around 50%.

// Interestingly, this has a constant time complexity. (HOTS)
